Think smartphones are everywhere now? According to research carried out by network experts Ericsson, they’re only going to get more popular over the next five years. Its estimates show an enormous jump from the 2.6 billion smartphone users recorded in 2014 to 6.1 billion by 2020.
The 6.1 billion phones represents 70 percent of the global population, and Ericsson also estimates 90 percent of the populated globe will have high-speed mobile data coverage by 2020. What’s particularly interesting is where the majority of these new phones will be sold. Ericsson says 80 percent of the new smartphone owners will be located in Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.
