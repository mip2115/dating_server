The stories of Scotty Bowers are the stuff of legend. As the tales go, he was an in-demand, bisexual Hollywood madame to the stars, arranging dates between Tinsletown's finest and a few of his friends regardless of gender and sexuality. He first wrote about the career he fashioned for himself in his 2012 biography Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars before it was given the documentary treatment in Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood. Ryan Murphy gave it his lush cinematic look as the character of Ernie in Netflix's Hollywood, and now Luca Guadagnino, Seth Rogen, and Even Goldberg are taking a stab at it. 

Announced in 2018, the new drama will be based on the Scotty and the Secret History documentary. In fact, Matt Tyrnauer, who directed that project, will be a producer of the new Searchlight film. Rogen and Goldberg will write the script while Guadagnino will direct according to Deadline.

Before he was a hustler, Bowers was a World War II Marine. After returning from the war, he started to work at a gas station which became his base of operations for his hustling. He did odd jobs for celebs, performing as a bartender and more, but later became known for his date arranging, which he did at a time where homosexuality was heavily stigmatized. While Ernie, the Ryan Murphy character loosely based on him owned, owned the gas station, Bowers simply worked there. When he released his book in 2012 which detailed the sex lives of his clients, most of them had died. According to him his client list included Rock Hudson, Katherine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Cary Grant, and more. He was married five times.
